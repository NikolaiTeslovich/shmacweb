### Our Goal
To empower individuals, having their interests in engineering and science come to life in a non-traditional learning environment through *Mens et Manus*. The way we set out to do this is to make this club accessible to anyone by making it free through funding by grants. Our members will collaborate, design, construct, innovate, and learn to fly aircraft that they make themselves like the one shown below.

### Becoming a Member

Anyone is welcome as long as they are a high school student at the State College Area School District.

We **used to meet** on Tuesdays in room D002. However, due to the pandemic, things have obviously changed to a mostly virtual format.

Email us to sign up for the mailing list.
