### Our Goal
To empower individuals to have their interests in engineering and science come to life in a non-traditional learning environment through *Mens et Manus*. The way we set out to do this is to make this club accessible to anyone by making it absolutely free. Our members will design and construct, innovate, and learn to fly aircraft that they make themselves like the one below.

### Becoming a Member

Anyone is welcome as long as they are a high school student at the State College Area School District.

We **used to meet** on Tuesdays in room D002. However, due to the pandemic, things have obviously changed to a mostly virtual format.

Email us to sign up for the mailing list.
