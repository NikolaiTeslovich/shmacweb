### Our Goal
To empower individuals to have their interests in engineering and science come to life in a non-traditional learning environment through *Mens et Manus*. The way we set out to do this is to make this club accessible to anyone by making it absolutely free. Our members will design and construct, innovate, and learn to fly aircraft that they built themselves.
