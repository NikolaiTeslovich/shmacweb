Note to myself, link in the proposal.

## However, this not our first source of funding

Just to be clear, this is not our first source of funding, it's just the first **substantial** one!

The first funding was directly from the one and only **amazing Mr. Johnson**, State College Area High School's Principal. He bought us 50 sheets of foam-board out of which we started building airplanes until the pandemic hit.

We also received a small grant for $200 from the PTSO, which we are planning to keep as a rainy-day fund.

Now, what good is an airplane without a motor or control surfaces. Pretty useless I dare say! Let's also not forget the fact that these gliders are dangerously close to the boring Science Olympiad Wright Stuff event. Trust me, I know from experience that it's no fun building fiddly minuscule rubber-band powered balsa airplanes only to have them fall apart right before the competition!

Rant over. Apart from this event, I have nothing against Science Olympiad.

## We now have $1750 at our disposal!

All of this glider business is about to change as we have some significant funds at out disposal thanks to the Patrick Wang Grant. We are planning to buy all of the electronics and parts, along with radio transmitters so that everyone in the club can build their own airplane and be able to fly it at out unofficial socially distant meetups.

In fact, earlier today, I just picked it up from the school!
