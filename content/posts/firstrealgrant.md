Note to myself, link in the proposal.

Earlier today, I just picked up some of these materials bought with the grant from the school!

## The long wait is over, we now have $1750 at our disposal!
**Earlier this month, we were confirmed for the Patrick Wang Grant!**

With this source of funds, we bought some stuff. Out of this stuff, Niels and I will [make kits](/posts/2020/01/flite-test-tiny-trainer-kits/) (this time including electronics), enabling the construction of the Flite Test Mini Mighty Trainer.

These kits will then be distributed to the club's members and they will build them at home during weekly meetings. When everyone has finished building, we will meet at a local park while socially distancing and wearing masks to teach others how to fly.

## Implementation schedule

*Dec-Jan:* Niels and I make the kits

*Jan:* Distribute the kits

*Jan-March:* Members will build the aircraft

*March-April:* Meet in a local park and teach members how to fly

*April-June:* Keep flying, transition from the large wing to the sports-style wing with ailerons, and maybe build some new aircraft

## However, this not our first source of funding

Just to be clear, this is not our first source of funding, it's just the first substantial one!

The first funds were directly from the one and only amazing Mr. Johnson, State College Area High School's principal. He bought us 100 sheets of foam-board out of which we started building airplanes until the pandemic hit.

We also received a small grant for $200 from the PTSO, which we are planning to keep as a rainy-day fund.

Now, what good is an airplane without a motor or control surfaces. Pretty useless I dare say! Let's also not forget the fact that these gliders are dangerously close to the boring Science Olympiad Wright Stuff event. Trust me, I know from experience that it's no fun building fiddly minuscule rubber-band powered balsa airplanes only to have them fall apart right before the competition!

All of this glider business is about to change as we have some significant funds at out disposal thanks to the Patrick Wang Grant. We have already bought most of the electronics and parts, along with radio transmitters so that everyone in the club can build their own airplanes and be able to learn how to fly it at our unofficial socially distant meetups. The reason it's only some of the parts is because the school still needs to approve some of the RC vendors. Do not fret, we are working on approving them currently.

Disclaimer so I don't get sued: I have nothing against Science Olympiad apart from this event.
