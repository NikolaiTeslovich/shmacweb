Crashing planes and other accidental actions that result in the destruction of property are NOT acts of vandalism. The only exception to this is if the member was being careless.
If someone is determined to be purposely destroying, or stealing club materials, they will be permanently expelled from the club and may face punishment in accordance with the school handbook.

The officer positions are as follows:

If a person in office leaves or graduates, an election is held to fill this position. Every member has a vote, and the majority rules. (Except for the president/vice president positions. If the president leaves, the vice president fills their position. If the vice president leaves the president decides who fills their place)

The advisor may only be changed if he is no longer willing/no longer able to advise.

### Section 6: Decision Making
