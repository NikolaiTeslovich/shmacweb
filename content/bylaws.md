### Abstract
These are the Bylaws and Constitution of the State High Model Aeronautics Club. They can be amended if both founders agree on it. If the founders are no longer present, 4/5 of elected officials must agree including supervisor.

### Section 1: Respect for Peers
Obviously like other clubs and daily life show respect for yourself and to your peers. We have a zero-tolerance policy meaning that you will be kicked out of the club with no hope of re-admission

 - No racism
 - No sexism
 - No harassment

### Section 2: Safety
Observe general safety practices. For example:

- Use knives and other tools for their designed use. (Don’t pry, bend, etc.)
- Use glue guns in a safe way and be aware of potential burn hazards.

Know how to handle LiPo batteries.

- Always set them to storage after use.
- Don't stab/bend/deface the batteries in any way.
- **ALWAYS** return LiPos to their designated storage locations.
- **ALWAYS** verify the charger settings.
- Have proper training in using the LiPo chargers.
- Check with people who know before doing something you are unsure of.
- Just don’t do dumb stuff and you’ll be fine.

### Section 3: Flight
You are responsible for your actions, for example, the plane you fly.

- Only fly with permission from a teacher or supervisor.
- Always have at least one experienced individual/teacher present to fly.
  - Buddy box if possible.
- Do not intentionally try to collide with others unless we are doing combat.
- Keep the plane in your line of sight at ALL times.

### Section 4: Property of the Club
Objects purchased by the club are club property. This includes electronics, building materials/equipment, and planes.

Do not steal or vandalize property of the club, or properties that are on loan from the club.

- Crashing planes and other accidental actions that result in the destruction of property are **NOT** acts of vandalism. The only exception to this is if the member was being careless.
- If someone is determined to be purposely destroying, or stealing club materials, they may face SCASD punishment.
- You will be kicked out of the club with a zero-tolerance policy.


### Section 5: Leadership
The officer positions are as follows:

If a person in office leaves or graduates, an election is held to fill this position. Every member has a vote, and the majority rules. (Except for the president/vice president positions. If the president leaves, the vice president fills their position. If the vice president leaves the president decides who fills their place)

### Section 6: Decision Making
Decisions will be made by the majority vote of the president/vice-president, and the supervisor.

### Section 7: Liability
