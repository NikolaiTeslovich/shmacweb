                <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>These are the Bylaws and Constitution of the State High Model Aeronautics Club. They can be amended if both founders agree on it. If the founders are no longer present, 4/5 of elected officials must agree including supervisor.</p>
<h3 id="our-goal">Our Goal</h3>
<p>To empower individuals to have their interests in engineering and science come to life in a non-traditional learning environment through <em>Mens et Manus</em>. The way we set out to do this is to make this club accessible to anyone by making it absolutely free. Our members will design and construct, innovate, and learn to fly aircraft that they built themselves.</p>
<h3 id="section-1-respect-for-peers">Section 1: Respect for Peers</h3>
<p>Obviously like other clubs and daily life show respect for yourself and to your peers. We have a zero-tolerance policy meaning that you will be kicked out of the club with no hope of re-admission</p>
<ul>
<li>No racism</li>
<li>No sexism</li>
<li>No harassment</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-2-safety">Section 2: Safety</h3>
<p>Observe general safety practices. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use knives and other tools for their designed use. (Don’t pry, bend, etc.)</li>
<li>Use glue guns in a safe way and be aware of potential burn hazards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Know how to handle LiPo batteries.</p>
<ul>
<li>Always set them to storage after use.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t stab/bend/deface the batteries in any way.</li>
<li><strong>ALWAYS</strong> return LiPos to their designated storage locations.</li>
<li><strong>ALWAYS</strong> verify the charger settings.</li>
<li>Have proper training in using the LiPo chargers.</li>
<li>Check with people who know before doing something you are unsure of.</li>
<li>Just don’t do dumb stuff and you’ll be fine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not steal or vandalize property of the club, or properties that are on loan from the club.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crashing planes and other accidental actions that result in the destruction of property are <strong>NOT</strong> acts of vandalism. The only exception to this is if the member was being careless.</li>
<li>If someone is determined to be purposely destroying, or stealing club materials, they may face SCASD punishment.</li>

</ul>
<p>The maximum term for any position is 2 years.</p>
<p>If a person in office leaves or graduates, an election is held to fill this position. Every member has a vote, and the majority rules. (Except for the president/vice president positions. If the president leaves, the vice president fills their position. If the vice president leaves the president decides who fills their place)</p>
<h3 id="section-6-decision-making">Section 6: Decision Making</h3>
<p>Decisions will be made by the majority vote of the president/vice-president, and the supervisor.</p>
<h3 id="section-7-liability">Section 7: Liability</h3>
<p>You agree to release any and all liabilities on SCASD and/or any and all members of the club.</p>
<p>You are responsible for your own plane. This includes abiding by all rules, laws, restrictions, and regulations.</p>
