      <description>Note to myself, link in the proposal.
Packages and a cart Ever since the pandemic struck, our supplies have been sitting in the school in room D002. The things purchased with the grant were also there. This needed to be addressed.
  Shoutout to Mr. Ruocchio—the best earth science teacher—for letting me borrow this cart. Here it is seen holding the foamboard that Mr. Johnson donated.
  Earlier today, I picked up some of these materials bought with the grant along with the foamboard.</description>
