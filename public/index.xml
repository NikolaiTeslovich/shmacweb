      <description>Introduction We needed to start doing something in our club instead of slightly messing around. Niels and I had agreed on a plane—the Flite Test Mini Mighty Trainer—to build as groups in the club. But there was a slight issue: we only had raw foam-board and not the actual cut-out kits. I had an MPCNC (mostly printed CNC) at my house and looked into how I could cut out kits from the raw foam-board.</description>

      <description>Pre-COVID-19   Our Goal To empower individuals, having their interests in engineering and science come to life in a non-traditional learning environment through Mens et Manus. The way we set out to do this is to make this club accessible to anyone by making it free through funding by grants. Our members will design, construct, innovate, and learn to fly aircraft that they make themselves like the one shown below.</description>
